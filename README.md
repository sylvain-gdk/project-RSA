# project-RSA
This program allows for text encryption using RSA algorithm.

(Could be used to have an encrypted conversation over email.)

Requirements: 2 people need to have a copy of this program and a copy of the same key file installed on their computers.

1- Set a path to store the key file, named privateKey.dat (i.e. /Users/YOUR_NAME/Documents/privateKey.dat)

2- If you already have a key installed, start writing your message and encrypt it. Otherwise generate a new key to share.

3- Copy the encrypted message and paste in an email or something (also send the key file as attachement the first time)

4- The other user will be able to decrypt your message by setting the path to the key file you sent.

note: of course, if anyone else has access to your key file, they will also be able to decrypt your messages.
